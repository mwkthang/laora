								<p>When it comes
									to
									Bitcoin
									and
									other
									cryptocurrencies,
									many
									banks
									around
									the
									globe
									steer
									clear.
									They
									often
									avoid or
									even ban
									the use
									of
									crypto
									in their
									accounts
									due to a
									perceived
									threat
									to FIAT
									currency
									and
									their
									operations
									as a
									whole.
								</p>
								<p>They also
									tend to
									believe
									there is
									a high
									risk of
									fraud
									and
									money
									laundering
									when
									crypto
									is in
									use.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p>Even with
									these
									concerns,
									many
									banks
									have
									opened
									their
									doors to
									customers
									using
									cryptocurrency.&nbsp;
									As more
									and more
									merchants
									have
									added
									cryptocurrency
									as a
									payment
									option,
									the
									demand
									has
									increased.&nbsp;
									Many of
									these
									banks
									have
									integrated
									with <a
										href="https://www.eupaymentz.com/high-risk-payment-processing/cryptocurrency-merchant-accounts/">crypto
										payment
										processing</a>
									services
									to
									handle
									all
									types of
									settlements
									between
									businesses
									and
									consumers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
								</p>
								<p>Finding
									crypto-friendly
									banks
									can be a
									challenge
									at
									times.
									Here are
									some of
									the best
									Bitcoin
									banks
									open for
									cryptocurrency
									for both
									consumers
									and
									merchants:
